### Real Estate Data Gathering and Preparation:
###### notebook: https://github.com/klleung72781/fintech_project_1/blob/master/data_gathering.ipynb

1. **Demand**: finding the most densely populated counties in the US, since population density is not a readily available stat, we used 2 datapoints to yield the desired results.
    - Since 2019 is not a census year, we decided to use the 2019 population estimate available on Census.gov:\
        https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/technical-documentation/file-layouts.html
    - Population density = Population / Land Area (this was obtained from Census TIGER/Line shapefiles):
        https://www.census.gov/geographies/mapping-files/time-series/geo/tiger-line-file.html\
        The county `shp` file also contains latitudes and longitudes of each county, useful for plotting on a map.
        ![Population Density](Images/population_density_bubble_map.png)
        **Top 10**
        | County Name | Population Density<br>(*People per Sq. Mile*) |

2. **Market Value**:  finding the counties with the highest median income
    - CensusData python library provides easy access to the data\
        https://pypi.org/project/CensusData/
    - Combining the data with TIGER/Line shapefiles to create a bubble map visualization\

### REITs Data Gathering and Preparation:
###### notebook: https://github.com/klleung72781/fintech_project_1/blob/master/REIT.ipynb
###### REITS are an alternative investment option to those that want to invest in real estate, but do not have the funds to buy property or simply do not qualify for mortgage. Reits historically have delivered competitive high returns based on long term capital appreciation. This analysis will use hvplots visualizations to plot the top 15 REITS by market CAP, calculate rolling statistics, betas and compare them to the trends of S&P 500 market Cap index over time.

1. **Identify the REITs**: This section analyzes the Top 15 REITs by Market Cap (data acquired from Yahoo! Finance)
    - This analysis will use hvplots visualizations to plot the top 15 REITS by market CAP.\

        | Symbol | Name | Market Cap<br>(*Billion*) |
        | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
        | AMT | American Tower Corporation (REIT) | 111.217 |
        | PLD | Prologis, Inc. | 75.827 |
        | CCI | Crown Castle International Corp. (REIT) | 68.977 |
        | EQIX | Equinix, Inc. (REIT) | 68.200 |
        | SPG-PJ | Simon Property Group, Inc. | 52.987 |

    - Daily Returns

3. **Compare to S&P 500**: Finding the beta against S&P 500
    - Calculate 30-Day Rolling Betas of REIT Stock Returns vs. S&P 500 Returns

### Conclusion:
- It is important to return to the initial hypotheses. The main null hypothesis is that investment in physical real estate property does not provide a greater return than an investment in any combination of REITs and stock indices. In the determination of the ideal real estate market for the purchase of property, there were two supporting hypotheses. One ancillary hypothesis is that population density does not have any relationship with real estate property values. Another ancillary hypothesis is that median household income does not have any relationship with real estate property values.

- One could both make and win the argument that the supporting null hypotheses were disproven with the tabulation of the data and the construction of the maps. The highest real estate property values had an association with population density. In addition, the highest real estate property values had an association with median household income.

- With the strong possibility of synergistic relationships among population density, median household income, and real estate property values, an ideal real estate market was identified. This market was identified as Saint Petersburg, Florida. Given a set investment of a fixed sum over a given period, this investment would have provided a return that far outweighs the returns from any investment in REITs or stock indices. In addition, this set investment may not be complete in that this set investment may not include the collections from renting the supposed property.

- It is important to reassert the ancient disclaimer that past performance does not guarantee future results. Nobody can determine future events, and in the case that anyone could determine future events, then that person would behave accordingly. The exercises of Group Two serve to provide the reader with an analysis of data to this point. Based on the data, it was possible to select for high value real estate markets based on population density. Furthermore, based on the data, it was possible to select for high value real estate markets based on median household income. This data was used to filter down to a specific select real estate market. The comparison with the historical returns from combinations of REITs and stock market indices established that investment in real estate property brought a higher return. Given the extra benefits of physical ownership and the flexibility to rent the property, one can disprove the overarching null hypothesis. It is better to invest in physical real estate than in REITs and stocks.
