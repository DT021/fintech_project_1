## Introduction:
- Is it worth it to invest in US real estate? How much money can one make by investing in real estate (investment in real estate = buying a property to rent out)?
- What makes an ideal real estate market for an investor?
- How can we use what we have learned up to this point to find an ideal real estate market?
- How can we use what we have learned up to this point to predict earnings from an investment in real estate?
- What is a Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT)? REIT = stock for real estate.
- How does investing in real estate compare with investing in other investment vehicles (Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs), Stock Indices, etc.)?
- How can we leverage what we have learned so far to predict the value of investments?

### Real Estate Data Gathering and Preparation:
###### notebook: https://github.com/klleung72781/fintech_project_1/blob/master/data_gathering.ipynb

1. **Demand**: finding the most densely populated counties in the US, since population density is not a readily available stat, we used 2 datapoints to yield the desired results.
    - Since 2019 is not a census year, we decided to use the 2019 population estimate available on Census.gov:\
        https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/technical-documentation/file-layouts.html
    - Population density = Population / Land Area (this was obtained from Census TIGER/Line shapefiles):
        https://www.census.gov/geographies/mapping-files/time-series/geo/tiger-line-file.html\
        The county `shp` file also contains latitudes and longitudes of each county, useful for plotting on a map.
        ![Population Density](Images/population_density_bubble_map.png)
        **Top 10**
        | County Name | Population Density<br>(*People per Sq. Mile*) | 
        | ----------- | ----------- |
        | **New York County**<br>New York | 71874 |
        | **Kings County**<br>New York | 36901 |

    - CensusData python library provides easy access to the data\
        https://pypi.org/project/CensusData/
    - Combining the data with TIGER/Line shapefiles to create a bubble map visualization\
        ![Household Income](Images/household_income.png)

### Vanguard Fund Data Gathering and Preperation:
###### notebook: https://github.com/klleung72781/fintech_project_1/blob/master/ACTUAL%20FINAL%20VANGUARD.ipynb

In order to compare the perfomace of the Real Estate markets analyzed we looked at nine of the core Vanguard Mutual Funds. We looked at those because they represent investments that are often made by a typical investor, and because they represent several different ways of capturing the performance of large parts of the market. The first one, Vangaurd Total Stock Market ETF (VTI) attempts to capture the performance of the entire stock market by using the CRSP Total Market Index. The Vanguard Total Inernational Stock Index (VXUS) uses an index that tracks the performance of all stock markets outside the US. Vanguard's Total Bond Market ETF (BND) is intended to track the performance of the entire US Bond market and is identified as a stable long term investment that's a good way to diversify equity investments. Vanguard Total International Bond ETF (BNDX) attempts to mirror the performance of an index that represents the non-US investment grade bond market hedged in US Dollars. The next set of funds looks at a smaller part of the US Market. Vanguard Growth ETF (VUG) replecates the performance of the CRSP Large Cap Growth Index, the Vanguard Small-Cap ETF (VB) mirrors the performance of a CRSP index of stocks with a small market cap, Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (VOO) track the S&P 500, and the Vanguard Russell 1000 Growth ETF (VONG) mirros an Russel index that tracks stock with good potential for long term growth and is volitaile but is said to have excellent long term growth potential.  All of the funds mentioned here are passively managed. The descriptions of the objectives of the funds are taken from Vanguard's website, and CRSP is the Center for Research in Stock Prices. The data was retrieved from Alpaca.

INSERT FIRST AND SECOND GRAPH.

The portfolio of equally weighted funds and each of the individual funds, which represent the US Market as a whole, the S&P 500, and domestic and foreign bond markets were greatly outperformed by the real estate markets identified above.

INSERT THIRD AND FOURTH GRAPH.

The notebook allows a user to pick as many stocks as they are interested in and create their own portfolio that's weighted as they choose. The pictures depict some well known companies.

The code then attempts to run a Monte Carlo Analysis on the funds or stocks two at a time, but it's not running for an unknown reason despite it being identical to code that worked in the API homework.

### REITs Data Gathering and Preparation:
###### notebook: https://github.com/klleung72781/fintech_project_1/blob/master/REIT.ipynb
###### REITS are an alternative investment option to those that want to invest in real estate, but do not have the funds to buy property or simply do not qualify for mortgage. Reits historically have delivered competitive high returns based on long term capital appreciation. This analysis will use hvplots visualizations to plot the top 15 REITS by market CAP, calculate rolling statistics, betas and compare them to the trends of S&P 500 market Cap index over time.

1. **Identify the REITs**: This section analyzes the Top 15 REITs by Market Cap (data acquired from Yahoo! Finance)
    - This analysis will use hvplots visualizations to plot the top 15 REITS by market CAP.\
    ![Top 15 Market Cap REITs](Images/Top_market_cap(5).png)

        | Symbol | Name | Market Cap<br>(*Billion*) |

        | PLD | Prologis, Inc. | 75.827 |
        | CCI | Crown Castle International Corp. (REIT) | 68.977 |

        | SPG-PJ | Simon Property Group, Inc. | 52.987 |

3. **Compare to S&P 500**: Finding the beta against S&P 500
    - Calculate 30-Day Rolling Betas of REIT Stock Returns vs. S&P 500 Returns

## Conclusion:
- It is important to return to the initial hypotheses. The main null hypothesis is that investment in physical real estate property does not provide a greater return than an investment in any combination of REITs and stock indices. In the determination of the ideal real estate market for the purchase of property, there were two supporting hypotheses. One ancillary hypothesis is that population density does not have any relationship with real estate property values. Another ancillary hypothesis is that median household income does not have any relationship with real estate property values.

- One could both make and win the argument that the supporting null hypotheses were disproven with the tabulation of the data and the construction of the maps. The highest real estate property values had an association with population density. In addition, the highest real estate property values had an association with median household income.

- With the strong possibility of synergistic relationships among population density, median household income, and real estate property values, an ideal real estate market was identified. This market was identified as Saint Petersburg, Florida. Given a set investment of a fixed sum over a given period, this investment would have provided a return that far outweighs the returns from any investment in REITs or stock indices. In addition, this set investment may not be complete in that this set investment may not include the collections from renting the supposed property.

- It is important to reassert the ancient disclaimer that past performance does not guarantee future results. Nobody can determine future events, and in the case that anyone could determine future events, then that person would behave accordingly. The exercises of Group Two serve to provide the reader with an analysis of data to this point. Based on the data, it was possible to select for high value real estate markets based on population density. Furthermore, based on the data, it was possible to select for high value real estate markets based on median household income. This data was used to filter down to a specific select real estate market. The comparison with the historical returns from combinations of REITs and stock market indices established that investment in real estate property brought a higher return. Given the extra benefits of physical ownership and the flexibility to rent the property, one can disprove the overarching null hypothesis. It is better to invest in physical real estate than in REITs and stocks.
